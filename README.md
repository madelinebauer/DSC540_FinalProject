# Data Wrangling

The goal for this project was to select data from the following types of sources:
1. CSV
2. Website
3. API
that had a relationship between them. Each data source had to be cleaned and formatted. Once the three data sources were each cleaned and formatted, they were merged together and loaded into a database. The final step was to create data visualizations with the data pulled from the database (SQL).
